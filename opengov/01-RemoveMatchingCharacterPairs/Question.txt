# Question 1
# A string S consisting of the letters A, B, C and D is given. The string can be
# transformed either by removing a letter A together with an adjacent letter
# B, or by removing a letter C together with an adjacent letter D.
# Write a function:
# def solution(S)
# that, given a string S consisting of N characters, returns any string that:
# can be obtained from S by repeatedly applying the described
# transformation, and
# • cannot be further transformed.
# If at some point there is more than one possible way to transform the
# string, any of the valid transformations may be chosen.
# Examples:
# 1. Given S = "CBACD", the function may return "C", because one of the
# possible sequences of operations is as follows:
